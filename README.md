My playpen for learning basic OpenGL/Cairo

Not for other people to use or build anything useful with. Just the
base project I use while studying LearnOpenGL and building basic Cairo
demos I find on the internet (I'm not good enough to design my own!)

Probably only works on Linux, maybe Mac - Cairo is a bit of a fucker
about Windows.
